# goodrating

> An attempt to rate college football teams good.

## Summary

Todo

## Methodology (wip)

1. Number of wins (50%)
2. Performance relative to expectation (+/-) against spread (20%)
3. Adjusted Offense Ranking (10%)
4. Adjusted Defense Ranking (10%)
5. Adjusted Player Ranking (10%)

## Assumptions

Head-to-head doesn't matter in this rating. This is an attempt to quantify the "goodness" of team, not a predictor of game outcomes. Therefore, it is possible that a team will be rated above a team that beat them. Sorry.
