# goodrating

> An attempt to rate college football teams good.

## Summary

Todo

## Methodology (wip)

1. Winning percentage (45%)
2. Adjusted Offense rating (15%)
3. Adjusted Defense rating (20%)
4. Adjusted Player rating (20%)

Finally, take the sum of above and adjust using the team's performance relative to expectation, i.e. (+/-) against the spread.

## Assumptions

Head-to-head doesn't matter in this rating. This is an attempt to quantify the "goodness" of team, not a predictor of game outcomes. Therefore, it is possible that a team will be rated above a team that beat them. Sorry.
