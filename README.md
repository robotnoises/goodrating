# goodrating

> An attempt to rate college football teams (good).

## Consumer Warning

I enjoy college football and I enjoy lists. This rating system is, more than anything else, for my own enjoyment. Much of the "information" presented here is anecodtal, at best. 
That's intentional. Football is chaos. Football is simulated warfare. Any attempt to seriously quantify if should be met with tremendous skepticism.

## Summary

*goodrating* is an attempt to rate college football teams using the fewest number of statistics as possible. Like people, statistics have biases. 
In using a small number of factors, I hope to mitigate the effect of their bias.

> But David, how can a number be biased?

It's all about context. E.g. a team can have a 0.950 winning percentage, but that number doesn't account for the teams they played. A high winning percentge could be an indicator of 
greatness, but it can also be an indicator of their opponents weakness.

> Ok, what are you going to so about it then?

...

Just like any statistics-driven system, the rating (theoretically) will improve as the sample size increases.

## Methodology (wip)

1. Winning percentage (45%)
2. Adjusted Offense rating (15%)
3. Adjusted Defense rating (20%)
4. Adjusted Player rating (20%)

Finally, take the sum of above and adjust using the team's performance relative to expectation, i.e. (+/-) against the spread.

## Assumptions

Head-to-head doesn't matter in this rating. This is an attempt to quantify the "goodness" of team, not a predictor of game outcomes. Therefore, it is possible that a team will be rated above a team that beat them. Sorry.
